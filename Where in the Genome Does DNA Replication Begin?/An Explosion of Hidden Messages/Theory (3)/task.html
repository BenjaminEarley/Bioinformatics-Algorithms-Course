  <p>You can solve the Clump Finding Problem by applying your algorithm for the Frequent Words Problem to each window of length <em>L</em> in <em>Genome</em>. However, if your algorithm for the Frequent Words Problem is not very efficient, then such an approach may be impractical. For example, recall that <b>﻿FrequentWords</b>&nbsp;has O(<em>L</em><sup>2</sup> · <em>k</em>) running time. Applying this algorithm to each window of length <em>L</em> in <em>Genome</em> will result in an algorithm with O(<em>L</em><sup>2</sup> · <em>k</em> · |<em>Genome</em>|) running time. Moreover, even if we use a faster algorithm for the Frequent Words Problem (like the one described in <a href="/lesson/CS-The-Frequency-Array-2994/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Charging Station:</strong> The Frequency Array</a>), the running time remains high when we try to analyze a bacterial — let alone human — genome.
