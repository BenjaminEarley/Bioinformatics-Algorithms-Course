  <p>We find hundreds of different 9-mers forming (500,3)-clumps in the <em>E. coli</em> genome, and it is absolutely unclear which of these 9-mers might represent a <em>DnaA</em> box in the bacteriumâ€™s <em>ori</em> region.</p> 
  <p>At this point, an unseasoned researcher might give up, since it appears that we do not have enough information to locate <em>ori</em> in <em>E. coli</em>. But a fearless veteran bioinformatician would try to learn more about the details of replication in the hope that they provide new algorithmic insights into finding <em>ori</em>.</p>
