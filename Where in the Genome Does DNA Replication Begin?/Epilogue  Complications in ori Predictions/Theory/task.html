  <p>In this chapter, we have considered three genomes and found three different hypothesized 9-mers encoding <samp><strong><span style="color: #64b0f4;">ATGATCAAG</span></strong></samp> in <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>, <samp><span style="color:darkcyan"><strong>CCTACCACC</strong></span></samp> in <em>Thermotoga petrophila</em>, and <samp><span style="color:olivedrab"><strong>TTATCCACA</strong></span></samp> in <em>E. coli</em>. We must warn you that finding <em>ori</em> is often more complex than in the three examples we considered. Some bacteria have even fewer <em>DnaA</em> boxes than <em>E. coli</em>, making it difficult to identify them. The <em>ter</em> region is often located not directly opposite to <em>ori</em> but may be significantly shifted, resulting in reverse and forward half-strands having substantially different lengths. The position of the skew minimum is often only a rough indicator of <em>ori</em> position, which forces researchers to expand their windows when searching for <em>DnaA</em> boxes, bringing in extraneous repeated substrings. Finally, skew diagrams do not always look as nice as that of <em>E. coli</em>; for example, the skew diagram for <em>Thermotoga petrophila</em> is shown below.</p>

  <p><strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">STOP and Think</span></strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">:</span> What evolutionary process could possibly explain the shape of the skew diagram for <em>Thermotoga petrophila</em>?</p>
