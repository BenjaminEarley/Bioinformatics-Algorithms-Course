  <p>Using the skew to find replication origins was first proposed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8676740" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lobry, 1996</a> and also described in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9580676" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Grigoriev, 1998</a>. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/bioinformatics-for-biologists/how-do-replication-and-transcription-change-genomes/032192B2F465D63B9CC9BD5941CD7800" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Grigoriev, 2011 </a>provides an excellent introduction to the skew approach, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18660512" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Sernova and Gelfand, 2008</a> gave a review of algorithms and software tools for finding replication origins in bacteria. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15107501" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lundgren et al., 2004</a> demonstrated that archaea may have multiple&nbsp;<em>ori</em>. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/26/E243" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Wang et al., 2011</a> inserted an artificial <em>ori</em> into the <em>E. coli </em>genome and showed that it triggers replication. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3269012/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Xia, 2012</a> was the first to conjecture that bacteria may have multiple replication origins. <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-79" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gao and Zhang, 2008</a> developed the Ori-Finder software program for finding bacterial replication origins.</p>
