  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome to <em>Bioinformatics Algorithms</em>!</strong></h2> 
  <p>Thank you for joining us! This is the official text of the Bioinformatics Specialization on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coursera</a>.</p> 
  <p>If you're on the go, you can find a print companion at the <a href="http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">textbook website</a> or download an e-book from <a href="http://leanpub.com/findinghiddenmessagesindna" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LeanPub</a>. These resources contain bonus content not featured in the interactive text in the form of "Detours" that didn't quite make the cut into the main text.</p> 
  <p>You can start "reading" this book at any time by pressing the "<strong>â†’</strong>" button on your keyboard to take the first step.</p> 
  <p>We say "read" because we have added lots of interactive features to make this book fun. As you progress, you will find <strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">STOP and Think</span></strong> questions helping you reflect on the material and <strong><span style="color: #a03881;">Exercise Breaks</span></strong> testing your knowledge.</p> 
  <p>If you are following the Honors Track, then <strong><span style="color: #66cc66;">Code Challenges</span></strong> allow you to implement the bioinformatics algorithms that you encounter, You will also encounter <strong><span style="color: #64b0f4;">Charging Station</span></strong> mini-lessons along your way that will guide you through tricky computational concepts. For best results, try solving a Code Challenge <em>before</em> proceeding to a Charging Station.</p> 
  <p>On the next step, you'll see the excellent work of <a href="http://bearandfox.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Randall Christopher</a>, who provided fun cover art for every chapter. This textbook also owes a debt to <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kspham/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Son Pham</a> and <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gptesler/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gptesler/">Glenn Tesler</a>, who provided much valuable feedback on the manuscript.</p> 
  <p>Yet our most important critic is <strong>YOU</strong>. We have already made <i>hundreds</i> of changes to this text based on student feedback since 2013, and we plan to continue doing so.</p> 
  <p>Finally, at the bottom of this page you can find a video introduction to the Bioinformatics Specialization. Why are we dressed as a sheriff and deputy? We hope you will watch to find out :)</p> 
  <p>Happy Trails,</p>
