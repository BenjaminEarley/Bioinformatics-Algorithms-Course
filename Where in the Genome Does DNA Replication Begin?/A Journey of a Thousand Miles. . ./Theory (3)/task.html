  <p>At first glance, a computer scientist might not imagine that these details have any computational relevance. To mimic the process in the above figure algorithmically, we only need to take a string representing the genome and return a copy of it! Yet if we take the time to review the underlying biological process, we will be rewarded with new algorithmic insights into analyzing replication. Replication begins in a genomic region called the <strong>replication origin</strong> (denoted <em>ori</em>) and is carried out by molecular copy machines called <strong>DNA polymerases</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Locating <em>ori</em> presents an important task not only for understanding how cells replicate but also for various biomedical problems. For example, some <strong>gene therapy</strong> methods use genetically engineered mini-genomes, which are called <strong>viral vectors</strong> because they are able to penetrate cell walls (just like real viruses). Viral vectors carrying artificial genes have been used in agriculture, such as to engineer frost-resistant tomatoes and pesticide-resistant corn. In 1990, gene therapy was first successfully performed on humans when it saved the life of a four-year-old girl suffering from Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disorder; the girl had been so vulnerable to infections that she was forced to live in a sterile environment.</p> 
  <p>The idea of gene therapy is to intentionally infect a patient who lacks a crucial gene with a viral vector containing an artificial gene that encodes a therapeutic protein. Once inside the cell, the vector replicates and eventually produces many copies of the therapeutic protein, which in turn treats the patient’s disease. To ensure that the vector actually replicates inside the cell, biologists must know where <em>ori</em> is in the vector’s genome and ensure that the genetic manipulations that they perform do not affect it.</p> 
  <p>In the following problem, we assume that a genome has a single <em>ori</em> and is represented as a <strong>DNA string</strong>, or a string of nucleotides from the four-letter alphabet {<samp>A</samp>, <samp>C</samp>, <samp>G</samp>, <samp>T</samp>}.</p>
