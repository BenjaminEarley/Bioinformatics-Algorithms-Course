  <p><strong>Genome replication</strong> is one of the most important tasks carried out in the cell. Before a cell can divide, it must first replicate its genome so that each of the two daughter cells inherits its own copy. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick completed their <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">landmark paper</a> on the DNA double helix with a now-famous phrase:</p> 
  <blockquote>
   <em>It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.</em>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>They conjectured that the two strands of the parent DNA molecule unwind during replication, and then each parent strand acts as a template for the synthesis of a new strand. As a result, the replication process begins with a pair of complementary strands of DNA and ends with two pairs of complementary strands, as shown below.</p>

  <p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Figure:</b> A naive view of replication. Nucleotides adenine (<samp>A</samp>) and thymine (<samp>T</samp>) are complements of each other, as are<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cytosine (<samp>C</samp>) and guanine (<samp>G</samp>). Complementary nucleotides bind to each other in DNA.</p> 
  <p>Although this figure successfully models DNA replication on a simple level, the details of replication turned out to be much more intricate than Watson and Crick imagined; as we will see, an astounding amount of molecular logistics is required to ensure DNA replication.</p>
