  <p>Although the Finding <em>ori</em> Problem asks a legitimate biological question, it does not present a well-defined computational problem. Indeed, biologists would immediately plan an experiment to locate <i>ori</i>: for example, they might delete various short segments from the genome in an effort to find a segment whose deletion stops replication. Computer scientists, on the other hand, would shake their heads and demand more information before they can even start thinking about the problem.</p> 
  <p>Why should biologists care what computer scientists think? Computational methods are now the only realistic way to answer many questions in modern biology. First, these methods are much faster than experimental approaches; second, the results of many experiments cannot be interpreted without computational analysis. In particular, existing experimental approaches to <em>ori</em> prediction are rather time consuming. As a result, <em>ori</em> has only been experimentally located in a handful of species. Thus, we would like to design a computational approach to find <em>ori</em> so that biologists are free to spend their time and money on other tasks.</p>
