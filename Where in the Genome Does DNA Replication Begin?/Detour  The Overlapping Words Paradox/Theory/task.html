  <p>We illustrate the overlapping words paradox with a two-player game called "Best Bet for Simpletons". Player 1 selects a binary <em>k</em>-mer <em>A</em>, and Player 2, knowing what <em>A</em> is, selects a different binary <em>k</em>-mer <em>B</em>. The two players then flip a coin multiple times, with coin flips represented by strings of <samp>1</samp> ("heads") and <samp>0</samp> ("tails"); the game ends when <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> appears as a block of <em>k</em> consecutive coin flips.</p>
