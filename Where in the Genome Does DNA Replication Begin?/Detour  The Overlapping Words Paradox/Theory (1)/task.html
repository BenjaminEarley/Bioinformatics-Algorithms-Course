  <p>At first glance, you might guess that every <em>k</em>-mer has an equal chance of winning. Yet suppose that Player 1 chooses <samp>00</samp> and Player 2 chooses <samp>10</samp>. After two flips, either Player 1 wins (<samp>00</samp>), Player 2 wins (<samp>10</samp>), or the game continues (<samp>01</samp> or <samp>11</samp>). If the game continues, then Player 1 should surrender, since Player 2 will win as soon as "tails" (<samp>0</samp>) is next flipped. Player 2 is therefore three times more likely to win!</p> 
  <p>It may seem that Player 1 should have the advantage by simply selecting the "strongest" <em>k</em>-mer. However, an intriguing feature of Best Bet for Simpletons is that if <em>k</em> &gt; 2, Player 2 can choose a <em>k</em>-mer <em>B</em> that beats <em>A</em>, <em>regardless</em> of Player 1's choice of <em>A</em>. Another surprise is that Best Bet for Simpletons is a <strong>non-transitive game</strong>: if <em>A</em> defeats <em>B</em>, and <em>B</em> defeats <em>C</em>, then we cannot automatically conclude that <em>A</em> defeats <em>C</em> (<em>c.f.</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" undefined="">rock-paper-scissors</a>).</p> 
  <p>The analysis of Best Bet for Simpletons is based on the notion of a correlation polynomial, introduced by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316581900054" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" undefined="">Guibas and Odlyzko, 1981</a>. We say that <em>B</em> <strong><em>i</em>-overlaps</strong> with <em>A</em> if the last <em>i</em> digits of <em>A</em> coincide with the first <em>i</em> digits of <em>B</em>. For example, <samp>110110</samp> 1-overlaps, 2-overlaps, and 5-overlaps with <samp>011011</samp>, as shown below.</p>
