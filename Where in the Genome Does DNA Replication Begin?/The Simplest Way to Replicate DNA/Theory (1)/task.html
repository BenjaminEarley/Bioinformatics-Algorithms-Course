  <p>When all four DNA polymerases have reached <em>ter</em>, the chromosome's DNA will have been completely replicated, resulting in two pairs of complementary strands shown in the lower figure, and the cell is ready to divide.</p>

  <p>Yet while you were reading this description, biology professors were writing a petition to have us fired and sent back to Biology 101. And they would be right, because our exposition suffers from a major flaw; we only described the replication process in this way so that you can better appreciate what we are about to reveal.</p>
