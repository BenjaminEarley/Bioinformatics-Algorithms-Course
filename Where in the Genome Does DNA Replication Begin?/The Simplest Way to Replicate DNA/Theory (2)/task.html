  <p>The problem with our current description is that it assumes that DNA polymerases can copy DNA in <em>either</em> direction along a strand of DNA (i.e., both 5’ → 3’ and 3’ → 5’). However, nature has not yet equipped DNA polymerases with this ability, as they are <strong>unidirectional</strong>, meaning that they can only traverse a template strand of DNA in the 3' → 5' direction, which is opposite from the 5’ → 3’ direction of DNA.</p>
  <p><strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">STOP and Think</span></strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">:</span> If you were a unidirectional DNA polymerase, how would you replicate DNA? How many DNA polymerases would be needed to complete this task? Why?<br></p>
