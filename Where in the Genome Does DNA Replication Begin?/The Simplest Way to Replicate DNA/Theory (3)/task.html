  <p>The unidirectionality of DNA polymerase requires a major revision to our naive model of replication. Imagine that you decided to walk along DNA from <em>ori</em> to <em>ter</em>. There are four different half-strands of parent DNA connecting <em>ori</em> to <em>ter</em>, as highlighted in the figure below. Two of these half-strands are traversed from <em>ori</em> to <em>ter</em> in the 5’ → 3’ direction and are thus called <strong>forward half-strands</strong> (represented by thin blue and green lines in the figure below). The other two half-strands are traversed from <em>ori</em> to <em>ter</em> in the 3’ → 5’ direction and are thus called <strong>reverse half-strands</strong> (represented by thick blue and green lines in the figure below).</p>
