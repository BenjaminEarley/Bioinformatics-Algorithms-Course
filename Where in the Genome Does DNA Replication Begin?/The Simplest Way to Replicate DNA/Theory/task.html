  <p>We are now ready to discuss the replication process in more detail. As illustrated in the figure below, the two complementary DNA strands running in opposite directions around a circular chromosome unravel, starting at <em>ori</em>. As the strands unwind, they create two <strong>replication forks</strong>, which expand in both directions around the chromosome until the strands completely separate at the <strong>replication terminus</strong> (denoted <em>ter</em>). The replication terminus is located roughly opposite to <em>ori</em> in the chromosome.</p>

  <p><strong>Figure:</strong> Four imaginary DNA polymerases at work replicating a chromosome as the replication forks extend from <em>ori</em> to <em>ter</em>. The blue strand is directed clockwise; the green strand is directed counterclockwise.</p> 
  <p>An important thing to know about replication is that a DNA polymerase does not wait for the two parent strands to completely separate before initiating replication; instead, it starts copying <em>while</em> the strands are unraveling, as shown in the figure above. Thus, just four DNA polymerases, each responsible for one half-strand, can all start at <em>ori</em> and replicate the entire chromosome. To start replication, a DNA polymerase needs a <strong>primer</strong>, a short complementary segment (shown in red above) that binds to the parent strand and jump starts the DNA polymerase. After the strands start separating, each of the four DNA polymerases starts replication by adding nucleotides, beginning with the primer and proceeding around the chromosome from <em>ori</em> to <em>ter</em> in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction.</p>
