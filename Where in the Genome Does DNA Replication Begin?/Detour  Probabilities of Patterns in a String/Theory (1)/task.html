  <p>We have seen that different <em>k</em>-mers have different probabilities of occurring multiple times as a substring of a random string. In general, this phenomenon is called the <strong>overlapping words paradox</strong> because different substring occurrences of <em>Pattern</em> can overlap each other for some choices of <em>Pattern</em> but not others (see <a class="_stepic_link" data-lesson="69" data-type="lesson" href="/lesson/lesson-69/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Detour: Overlapping Words Paradox</a>).</p> 
  <p>For example, there are two overlapping occurrences of <strong><span style="color:coral"><samp>11</samp></span></strong> in <samp>1110</samp>, and three overlapping occurrences in <samp>1111</samp>; yet occurrences of <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong> can never overlap with each other, and so <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong> can never occur more than twice in a binary 4-mer. The overlapping words paradox makes computing Pr(<em>N</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>Pattern</em>, <em>t</em>) a rather complex problem because this probability depends heavily on the particular choice of <em>Pattern</em>. In light of the complications presented by the overlapping words paradox, we will try to <em>approximate</em> Pr(<em>N</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>Pattern</em>, <em>t</em>) rather than compute it exactly.</p> 
  <p>To approximate Pr(<em>N</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>Pattern</em>, <em>t</em>), we will assume that the <em>k</em>-mer <em>Pattern</em> is not overlapping. As a toy example, say we we wish to count the number of <strong>ternary strings</strong> (<em>A</em> = 3) of length 7 that contain <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong> at least twice. Apart from the two occurrences of <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong>, we have three remaining symbols in the string. Let's assume that these symbols are all <samp>2</samp>. The two occurrences of <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong> can be inserted into <samp>222</samp> in ten different ways to form a 7-mer, as shown below.</p> 
  <p class="mono" style="text-align: center;"><samp style="text-align: center;"></samp></p>
  <p><span style="color:royalblue"><strong>0101</strong></span>222&nbsp;<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>2<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>22&nbsp;<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>22<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>2&nbsp;<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>222<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>&nbsp;2<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>0101</strong></span>22<br> 2<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>2<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>2&nbsp;2<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>22<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>&nbsp;22<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>0101</strong></span>2&nbsp;22<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>2<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>01</strong></span>&nbsp;222<span style="color:royalblue"><strong>0101</strong></span></p> 
  <p></p>
  <p>We inserted these two occurrences of <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong> into <samp>222</samp>, but we could have inserted them into any other ternary 3-mer. Because there are 3<sup>3</sup> = 27 total ternary 3-mers, we obtain an approximation of 10 Â· 27 = 270 for the total number of ternary 7-mers that contain two or more instances of <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong>. Because there are 3<sup>7</sup> = 2187 total ternary 7-mers, we estimate the probability Pr(7, 3, <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong>, 2) as 270/2187.</p> 
  <p><span style="color:crimson"><strong>STOP and Think</strong></span>: Is 270/2187 a good approximation for Pr(7, 3, <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong>, 2)? Is the true probability Pr(7, 3, <strong><span style="color:royalblue"><samp>01</samp></span></strong>, 2) larger or smaller than 270/2187?</p>
