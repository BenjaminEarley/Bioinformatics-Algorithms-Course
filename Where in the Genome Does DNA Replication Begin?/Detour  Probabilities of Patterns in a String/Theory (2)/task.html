  <p>To approximate P(<em>N</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>Pattern</em>,t), we want to count the number of ways to insert <em>t</em> instances of a <em>k</em>-mer <em>Pattern</em> into a fixed string of length <em>n</em> = <em>N</em> – <em>t</em> · <em>k</em>. We will therefore have <em>n</em> + <em>t</em> occurrences of <samp>X</samp>, from which we must select <em>t</em> for the placements of <em>Pattern</em>, giving a total of <span class="math-tex">\( \binom{n+t}{t} \)</span>. We then need to multiply <span class="math-tex">\( \binom{n+t}{t} \)</span> by the total number of strings of length <em>n</em> into which we can insert <em>t</em> instances of <em>Pattern</em> to have an approximate total of <span class="math-tex">\( \binom{n+t}{t} \cdot A^n \)</span> (the actual number will be smaller because of over-counting). Dividing by the total number of strings of length <em>N</em>, we have our desired approximation:</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\[ \mathrm{Pr}(N, A, \textit{Pattern},t) \approx \dfrac{\binom{n+t}{t} \cdot A^n}{A^N} = \dfrac{\binom{N-t \cdot k + t}{t} \cdot A^{N-t \cdot k}}{A^N} = \dfrac{\binom{N - t\cdot(k - 1)}{t}}{A^{t \cdot k}} \]</span></p> 
  <p>We will now compute the probability that the specific 5-mer <samp>ACTAT</samp> occurs at least <em>t</em> = 3 times in a random DNA string (<em>A</em> = 4) of length <em>N</em> = 30. Since <em>n</em> = <em>N</em> – <em>t</em> · <em>k</em> = 15, our estimated probability is</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\[ \mathrm{Pr}(30,4,\text{ACTAT},3) \approx \left.\binom{30-3 \cdot 4}{3} \middle/ 4^{15}\right. \approx 7.599 \cdot 10^{-7} \]</span></p> 
  <p>The exact probability is closer to 7.572 · 10<sup>-7</sup>, illustrating that our approximation is relatively accurate for non-overlapping patterns. However, it becomes inaccurate for overlapping patterns, e.g., Pr(30, 4, <samp>AAAAA</samp>, 3) ≈ 1.148 · 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p> 
  <p>We should not be surprised that the probability of finding <samp>ACTAT</samp> in a random DNA string of length 30 is so low. However, remember that our original goal was to approximate the probability that there exists <em>some</em> 5-mer appearing three or more times. In general, the probability that some <em>k</em>-mer appears <em>t</em> or more times in a random string of length <em>N</em> formed over an <em>A</em>-letter alphabet is written Pr(<em>N</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>t</em>).</p>
