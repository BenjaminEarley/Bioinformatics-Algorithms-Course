  <p> Although the frequencies of <samp>A</samp> and <samp>T</samp> are practically identical on the two half-strands, <samp>C</samp> is more frequent on the reverse half-strand than on the forward half-strand, resulting in a difference of 219518 - 207901 = <span style="color: #66cc66;"><b>+11617</b></span>. Its complementary nucleotide <samp>G</samp> is less frequent on the reverse half-strand than on the forward half-strand, resulting in a difference of 201634 - 211607 = <b><span style="color: #ff4363;">-9973</span></b>.</p> 
  <p>It turns out that we observe these discrepancies because cytosine (<samp>C</samp>) has a tendency to mutate into thymine (<samp>T</samp>) through a process called <strong>deamination</strong>. Deamination rates rise 100-fold when DNA is single-stranded, which leads to a decrease in cytosine on the forward half-strand. Also, since <samp>C-G</samp> base pairs eventually change into <samp>T-A</samp> base pairs, deamination results in the observed decrease in guanine (<samp>G</samp>) on the reverse half-strand (recall that a forward parent half-strand synthesizes a reverse daughter half-strand, and vice-versa).</p> 
  <p><strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">STOP and Think:</span></strong> If deamination changes cytosine to thymine, why do you think that the forward half-strand still has some cytosine?</p>
