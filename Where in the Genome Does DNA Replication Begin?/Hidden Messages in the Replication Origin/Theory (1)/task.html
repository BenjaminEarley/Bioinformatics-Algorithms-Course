  <p>How does the bacterial cell know to begin replication exactly in this short region within the much larger <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> chromosome, which consists of 1,108,250 nucleotides? There must be some “hidden message” in the <em>ori</em> region ordering the cell to begin replication here. Indeed, we know that the initiation of replication is mediated by <strong><em>DnaA</em></strong>, a protein that binds to a short segment within the <em>ori</em> known as a <strong><em>DnaA</em> box</strong>. You can think of the <em>DnaA</em> box as a message within the DNA sequence telling the <em>DnaA</em> protein: “bind here!” The question is how to find this hidden message without knowing what it looks like in advance—can you find it? In other words, can you find something that stands out in <em>ori</em>? This discussion motivates the following problem.</p> 
  <p><strong>Hidden Message Problem:</strong> <em>Find a “hidden message” in the replication origin.</em><br></p>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Input</strong><span>: A string </span><em>Text</em><span> (representing the replication origin of a genome).</span></li>
   <li><strong>Output</strong><span>: A hidden message in </span><em>Text</em><span>.</span></li>
  </ul> 
  <p><span><strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">STOP and Think</span></strong><span style="color: #ff4363;">:</span></span> Does the Hidden Message Problem represent a clearly stated computational problem?</p>
