  <p>Thanks for reading this far! We have covered a lot of material, but the chapter isn't finished yet. Each chapter in this book is accompanied by an epilogue (see the next lesson) considering additional practical considerations or complications of the central question. &nbsp;If you have completed the code challenges, then the epilogue terminates with a "Final Challenge" asking you to get your hands dirty and apply what you have learned to a real dataset. &nbsp;We hope that you will see how tricky dealing with raw biological data can be!</p>
  <p>If you enjoyed this material, please keep going! &nbsp;We also would like to suggest a couple of additional projects that might interest you.</p>
