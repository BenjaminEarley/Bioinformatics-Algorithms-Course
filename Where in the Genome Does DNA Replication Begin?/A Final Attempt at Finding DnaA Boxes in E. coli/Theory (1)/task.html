  <p>We do not know what purpose — if any — these other 9-mers serve in the <em>E. coli</em> genome, but we do know that there are <em>many different types</em> of hidden messages in genomes; these hidden messages have a tendency to cluster within a genome, and most of them have nothing to do with replication. One example is the regulatory DNA motifs responsible for gene expression that we will study soon. The important lesson is that existing approaches to <em>ori</em> prediction remain imperfect and are sometimes inconclusive. However, even providing biologists with a small collection of 9-mers as candidate <em>DnaA</em> boxes is a great aid as long as one of these 9-mers is correct.</p> 
  <p>Thus, the moral of this chapter is that even though computational predictions can be powerful, bioinformaticians should collaborate with biologists to verify their computational predictions. Or improve these predictions: the next question hints at how <em>ori</em> predictions can be carried out using <strong>comparative genomics</strong>, a bioinformatics approach that uses evolutionary similarities to answer difficult questions about genomes.</p>

After having learned what <em>DnaA</em> boxes look like in <em>E. coli</em>, how would you look for <em>DnaA</em> boxes in <em>Salmonella enterica</em>?</p>
