  <p>Meselson and Stahl had rejected the conservative and dispersive hypotheses of replication, and yet they wanted to make sure that the semiconservative hypothesis was confirmed by further <em>E. coli</em> replication. This model predicted that after three rounds of replication, one-quarter of the DNA molecules should still have a <sup>15</sup>N strand, causing 25% of the DNA to have an intermediate density, whereas the remaining 75% should be lighter, having only <sup>14</sup>N. This is indeed what Meselson and Stahl witnessed in the lab, and the semiconservative hypothesis has stood strong to this day.</p>
