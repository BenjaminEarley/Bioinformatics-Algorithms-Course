  <p>The Meselson-Stahl experiment, conducted in 1958 by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl, is sometimes called "the most beautiful experiment in biology". In the late 1950s, biologists debated three conflicting models of DNA replication, illustrated in the figure below. The <strong>semiconservative hypothesis</strong> suggested that each parent strand acts as a template for the synthesis of a daughter strand. As a result, each of the two daughter molecules contains one parent strand and one newly synthesized strand. The <strong>conservative hypothesis</strong> proposed that the entire double-stranded parent DNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of a new daughter molecule, resulting in one molecule with two parent strands and another with two newly synthesized strands. The <strong>dispersive hypothesis</strong> proposed that some mechanism breaks the DNA backbone into pieces and splices intervals of synthesized DNA, so that each of the daughter molecules is a patchwork of old and new double-stranded DNA.</p> 
  <p>The three models are illustrated below, with parent DNA colored yellow and newly synthesized DNA colored black.</p>
