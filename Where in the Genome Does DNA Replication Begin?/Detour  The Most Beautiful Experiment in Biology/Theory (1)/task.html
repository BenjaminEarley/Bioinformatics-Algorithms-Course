  <p>Meselson and Stahl's insight relied on the fact that one isotope of nitrogen, <strong>Nitrogen-14</strong> (<sup>14</sup>N), is lighter and more abundant than <strong>Nitrogen-15</strong> (<sup>15</sup>N). Knowing that the DNA molecular structure naturally contains <sup>14</sup>N , Meselson and Stahl grew E. coli for many rounds of replication in a <sup>15</sup>N medium, which caused the bacteria to gain weight as they absorbed the heavier isotope into their DNA.</p> 
  <p>When they were confident that the bacterial DNA was saturated with <sup>15</sup>N, they transferred these heavy <em>E. coli</em> cells to a less dense <sup>14</sup>N medium.</p>
