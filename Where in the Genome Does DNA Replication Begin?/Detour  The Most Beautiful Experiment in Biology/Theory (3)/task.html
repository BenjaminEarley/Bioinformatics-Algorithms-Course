  <p>Letâ€™s first consider the dispersive model, which says that each daughter strand of DNA is formed by half mashed up pieces of the parent strand, and half new DNA. If this hypothesis were true, then after two replication cycles, any daughter strand of DNA should contain about 25% <sup>15</sup>N and about 75% <sup>14</sup>N. In other words, all the DNA should still have the same density. And yet when Meselson and Stahl spun the centrifuge after two rounds of <em>E. coli</em> replication, this is not what they observed!</p> 
  <p>Instead, they found that the DNA divided into two different densities. This is exactly what the semiconservative model predicted: after one cycle, every cell should possess one <sup>14</sup>N strand and one <sup>15</sup>N strand; after two cycles, half of the DNA molecules should have one <sup>14</sup>N strand and one <sup>15</sup>N strand, while the other half should have two <sup>14</sup>N strands, producing the two different densities they noticed.</p>
