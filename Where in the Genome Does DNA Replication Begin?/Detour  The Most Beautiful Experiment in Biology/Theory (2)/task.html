  <p>The brilliance of the Meselson-Stahl experiment is that all newly synthesized DNA would contain exclusively <sup>14</sup>N, and the three existing hypotheses for DNA replication predicted different outcomes for how this <sup>14</sup>N isotope would be incorporated into DNA. Specifically, after one round of replication, the conservative model predicted that half the <em>E. coli</em> DNA would still have only <sup>15</sup>N and therefore be heavier, whereas the other half would have only <sup>14</sup>N and be lighter. Yet when they attempted to separate the <em>E. coli</em> DNA according to weight by using a centrifuge after one round of replication, all of the DNA had the same density! Just like that, they had refuted the conservative hypothesis once and for all.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, this experiment was not able to eliminate either of the other two models, as you can see that both the dispersive and semiconservative hypotheses predicted that all of the DNA after one round of replication would have the same density.</p>
