  <p>While biologists will feel at home with the following description of DNA replication, computer scientists may find it overloaded with new terms. If it seems too biologically complex, then feel free to skim this lesson, as long as you believe us that the replication process is <strong>asymmetric</strong>, i.e., that forward and reverse half-strands have very different fates with respect to replication. Alternatively, you may watch an excellent video describing strand asymmetry at <a href="http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/how-okazaki-fragments-of-the-lagging-strand-dna-are-replicated.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Education Portal</a>.</p> 
  <p>Since a DNA polymerase can only move in the reverse (3′ → 5′) direction, it can copy nucleotides non-stop from <em>ori</em> to <em>ter</em> along reverse half-strands, as shown in the figure below. However, replication on forward half-strands is very different because a DNA polymerase cannot move in the forward (5' → 3') direction; on these half-strands, a DNA polymerase must replicate <em>backwards</em> toward <em>ori</em>. Take a look at the figure below to see why this must be the case.</p>

  <p><strong>Figure:</strong> Replication begins at <em>ori</em> (primers shown in red) with the synthesis of fragments on the reverse half-strands (shown by thick lines). A DNA polymerase must wait until the replication fork has opened some (small) distance before it starts copying the forward half-strands (shown by thin lines) back toward <em>ori</em>.</p>
