  <p>On a forward half-strand, in order to replicate DNA, a DNA polymerase must wait for the replication fork to open a little (approximately 2,000 nucleotides) until a new primer is formed at the <i>end</i> of the replication fork; afterwards, the DNA polymerase starts replicating a small chunk of DNA starting from this primer and moving <i>backward</i> in the direction of <em>ori</em>. When the two DNA polymerases on forward half-strands reach <em>ori</em>, we have the situation shown below.</p>
