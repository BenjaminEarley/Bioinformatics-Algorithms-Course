  <p>When the replication fork reaches <em>ter</em>, the replication process is almost complete, as all DNA has been synthesized. However, gaps still remain between the disconnected Okazaki fragments, as shown below.</p>

  <p>Finally, consecutive Okazaki fragments are sewn together by an enzyme called <strong>DNA ligase</strong>, resulting in two intact daughter chromosomes, each consisting of one parent strand and one newly synthesized daughter strand. In reality, DNA ligase does not wait until after all the Okazaki fragments have been replicated to start sewing them together.</p>
