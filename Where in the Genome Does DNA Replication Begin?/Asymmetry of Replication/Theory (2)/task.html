  <p>After this point, replication on each reverse half-strand progresses continuously; however, a DNA polymerase on a forward half-strand has no choice but to wait again until the replication fork has opened another 2,000 nucleotides or so. It then requires a new primer to begin synthesizing another fragment back toward <em>ori</em>. On the whole, replication on a forward half-strand requires occasional stopping and restarting, which results in the synthesis of short <strong>Okazaki fragments</strong> from multiple primers that are complementary to intervals on the forward half-strands. You can see these fragments forming in the figure below.</p>

  <p><strong>Figure:</strong> The replication fork continues growing. Only one primer is needed for each of the reverse half-strands (shown by thick lines), while the forward half-strands (shown by thin lines) require multiple primers in order to synthesize Okazaki fragments. Two of these primers are shown in red on each forward half-strand.</p>
