  <p>Biologists call a reverse half-strand (thick lines) a <strong>leading half-strand</strong> since a single DNA polymerase traverses this half-strand non-stop, and they call a forward half-strand (thin lines) a <strong>lagging half-strand</strong> since it is used as a template by many DNA polymerases stopping and starting replication.</p> 
  <p>If you are confused about the differences between the leading and lagging half-strands, you are not alone â€” we and legions of biology students are also confused. The confusion is exacerbated by the fact that different textbooks use different terminology depending on whether the authors intend to refer to a leading <em>template</em> half-strand or a leading half-strand <em>that is being synthesized</em> from a (lagging) template half-strand. You hopefully see why we have chosen the terms "reverse" and "forward" half-strands in an attempt to mitigate some of this confusion.</p>
