  <p>Computer scientists typically measure an algorithm’s efficiency in terms of its worst-case <strong>running time</strong>, which is the largest amount of time an algorithm can take for the most difficult input of a given size. The advantage to considering the worst case running time is that we are guaranteed that our algorithm will never behave worse than our worst-case estimate.</p> 
  <p><strong>Big-O notation</strong> compactly describes the running time of an algorithm. For example, if your algorithm for sorting an array of <em>n</em> numbers takes roughly <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> operations for the most difficult dataset, then we say that the running time of your algorithm is O(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>). In reality, depending on your implementation, it may be use any number of operations, such as 1.5<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>n</em> + 2, or 0.5<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 1; all these algorithms are O(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>) because big-O notation only cares about the term that grows the fastest with respect to the size of the input. This is because as <em>n</em> grows very large, the difference in behavior between two O(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>) functions, like 999 · <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> and <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>n</em> + 9999999, is negligible when compared to the behavior of functions from different classes, say O(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>) and O(<em>n</em><sup>6</sup>). Of course, we would prefer an algorithm requiring 1/2 · <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> steps to an algorithm requiring 1000 · <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> steps.</p> 
  <p>When we write that the running time of an algorithm is O(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>), we technically mean that it does not grow faster than a function with a leading term of <em>c</em> · <em>n</em><sup>2</sup>, for some constant <em>c</em>. Formally, a function <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) is <strong>Big-O of function <em>g</em>(<em>n</em>)</strong>, or O(<em>g</em>(<em>n</em>)), when <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) ≤ <em>c</em> · <em>g</em>(<em>n</em>) for some constant <em>c</em> and sufficiently large <em>n</em>.</p>
